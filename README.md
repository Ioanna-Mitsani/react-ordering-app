## Description

This project was made to be the final assignment of Web Application course in SAE Athens (November 2021 - January 2022).

This repo consists the client-side part of this exercise (you can find the server-side over here: ...). Client-side was made with React (`create-react-app` template) & Material UI Elements.

The purpose of this Single-Page Application was to make a Food Ordering App with 5 main views: Home, Stores, Store, Cart & 404 page.

In Home view, the user enters his/her address. After (s)he presses the ORDER NOW button, moves on to the Store View where the List with the available stores is. Then, chooses a store and goes on to the detailed Store view where the store's info and product menu are. From that point, the user can add to cart the products (s)he wants. Finally, user proceeds to Cart/Checkout view, to edit the order by adding more or removing items from the cart. Last, user can complete the order, or clear the cart.


## How to run the app

Download the project folder with code files from dev/phase1 branch. Make sure you have installed npm or yarn on your computer. Open folder in IDE, then install the project dependecies with `npm install` or `yarn`. To run the project locally, hit `yarn start dev` or `npm start` and the project will be available to you in localhost:3000 by default.

## Available Scripts (yarn)

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn`

Installs all the project dependecies from package.json 

### `yarn start dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
